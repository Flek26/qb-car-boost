# qb-car-boost
FiveM Script for Car Boosting. Inspired by NoPixel. 
This is a custom script built for the QB-Core framework by Flek#0001. 
Discord DMs are open for any commissions. 

Just finalizing some things. Should be ready soon. 

## To Do:  
Vin Scratch.  
NUI tablet with rep.  
Planes, boats, and helicopter boosts.  
  
  
## Done:  
Ped spawn  
configurable locations. (25 by defaut).  
Receive random calls throughout the day for a boost. (Configurable Time and item needed to recieve calls).  
Configurable cars.  
Configurable car classes.  
Rep system  
    - all back end. For now Only way to see rep is to type /rep.  
    - config what rep is required for each class of car.   
Configurable Peds that spawn (chance for each spawn).  
Weapons the peds spawn with. (confirguarable)  
Lockpick to get into car. (Circle Lockpick like NP)v
Once in car, have to perform a variety of tasks to remove the tracker (sends ping to police every so often (configurable time)). (Requires item (Signal Jammer)).  
    - Tasks includes hacks from https://github.com/Jesper-Hustad/NoPixel-minigame but can be set up to use whatever.   
    - Signal jammer has 3 uses. If you fail a hack, you lose one point of durability. After 3 fails, the jammer breaks. (Jammer durability stays even after tsunami).   
    - If you sucessfully hit the hack, you still lose a use off the jammer. So if you have 100% success rate, you will be able to use it for 3 hacks.  
    - Once the jammer hack is successful, the car will stop sending pings to the police.   
Place to turn cars in. Two options when a player gets there. Scrap it (bunch of materials) or sell it for cash. (Both ammounts configurable per class).  
    - plus rep if success.  
    - minus rep if you dont turn car in after certain ammount of time. (default 45 mins).
